a list of all my Jekyll posts, organised by category


{% for category in site.categories %}
  <li><a name="{{ category | first }}">{{ category | first }}</a>
    <ul>
    {% for posts in category %}
      {% for post in posts %}
        <li><a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a></li>
      {% endfor %}
    {% endfor %}
    </ul>
  </li>
{% endfor %}


Iâ€™d like to list a fixed number of recent posts having the same category as the current post. This is what I have arrived at:

{% for post in site.categories[category_name] %}
    <li>{{ post.title }}</li>
{% endfor %}

You can generate a list of all the available categories by using the site.categories data, using the first element of each category (which is an array) to get the category name:

{% for cat in site.categories %}
    <li>{{ cat[0] }}</li>
{% endfor %}
And you can generate a list of all the posts in a given category like so:

{% for post in site.categories.CATEGORY_NAME %}

It doesn't seem possible to generate an individual HTML page for each category as you were hoping, but perhaps a good compromise would be to generate a single page containing a list of all categories, where each category contains all the posts in that category. You could then use some simple JavaScript to hide the posts in each category until the category name is selected, giving almost the same user experience as individual archive pages for each category.

You can use Dave Perett's generate_categories.rb plugin to automatically create a page for each category in your site. Then, use a for loop to run through your site categories and create a link for each in your navigation (or wherever you want to link to the archive pages), as Jon did in his answer to your quesiton.
